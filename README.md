# raccoon-tools-editor-lite
Simplified web level editor for creating tactics game levels in one of my toy game engines.

Web hosted tool that will allow for importing and exporting json based level files.

There are various simple tools and a visualizer for placing Players, Enemies, and Obstacles on a simple Grid.

TODOs:
- Add GitHub deployment to some static hosting
- Improve visualizer dimensions they're a little wonky, but mostly work for what I am doing. Not high priority atm.
